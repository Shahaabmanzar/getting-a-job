This is a document with advice for people starting out in web dev and trying to get a job. I am not an expert and this is neither exhaustive nor definitive. Much of this is probably debatable.

If you have any suggestions or corrections, please drop me a line at kevinsmithwebdev@gmail.com.
I personally would request you to choose a development specialization
